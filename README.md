A 3d Delta printer based on the Mini-Kossel but using 2040 Makerslide for the
towers and the carriages.

This is a Makerslide and Misumi based frame, using Spectra fishing line drive
ala Kossel, and has a large frame made from 2040 and 2020 Misumi using mini-kossel style printed brackets.

The default version has 1000mm high Makerslide towers, an 463.4mm triangle sides, and 
arm length of 370mm, which makes for a roughly 250mm circular build area using Traxxas joints
and 400mm build height.

The scad source files are parameterized so the dimensions can be
tweaked.

Many of the scad files are derived from Kossel files, some are
original designs by me.

All are under the same licensing as Kossel.

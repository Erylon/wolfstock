This Delta 3D printing robot is derived from Kossel, Rostock and and
Ostoc, which was briefly described in the google group.

It is a big bot providing about a twelve cubic inch build volume.

It uses Makerslide for the linear guides, but any 2040 extrusion with
appropriate wheels should work.

I use Misumi extrusions and brackets, and the scad files use the 3d
cad programs from Misumi for display purposes.

It is based on a T shape where the Makerslide towers are at right
angles, which simplifies the attachment points.

This is a Makerslide and Misumi based frame, using Spectra fishing line drive
ala Kossel, and has square T Frame based on an Ostoc design.

The default version has 1000mm high Makerslide towers, and 500mm
triangle sides, which makes for a roughly 12"x12"x12" build volume.

The scad source files are parameterized so the dimensions can be
tweaked.

Many of the scad files are derived from Kossel files, some are
original designs by me.

All are under the same licensing as Kossel.
